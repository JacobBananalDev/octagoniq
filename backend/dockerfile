# Copy dependency file first
# We copy this before the source code to leverage Docker layer caching
# If requirements.txt doesn't change, Docker won't reinstall dependencies

# Command to run when the container starts
# - uvicorn runs the FastAPI server
# - app.main:app means:
#     folder: app
#     file: main.py
#     object inside file: app
# - 0.0.0.0 allows the container to accept external connections
# - port 8000 is exposed by docker-compose
